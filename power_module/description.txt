POWER/DATA MODULE

Description:
	Use the outputs from the OM and ACS modules to calculate:
		the solar irradiance in the vicinity of the spacecraft 
		total power generated by the solar panels taking into account the geometry and orientation of the spacecraft (including accounting for shading).
	Calculate battery state of charge over time taking into account:
		eclipse duration
		power consumption information from other modules
	A detailed energy flow/power budget will be maintained taking into account:
		the output of the scheduler to ensure that energy constraints are satisfied

Input modules:
	OM module
		- Location in orbit
	ACS module
		- Orientation in orbit
	Optimizer
		- Sensors active at time t_current
	
Input:
	Location
		r = [x, y, z]
	Orientation
		q = [q0, q1, q2, q3]
	Current Plan
		

Output:
	Solar Irradience
	Power generation vs time
	Battery State vs time
	Warnings if power consumption is close to being surpassed
	Errors if power consumption is surpassed
